## Contribute!
Artists are welcome to contribute in the Assets/ folder. Preferred tool to be used is Krita which generates .kra files.
Icons and pictures should be white with transparent background. (An easy method is drawing with regular black, then use the "invert"-filter in krita.

Otherwise coders and techsavvy people are free to make pull requests which @Vargdidan will review and hopefully merge when he has time.
